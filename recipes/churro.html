        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
            <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. butter</li>
            <li>1 cup (140g) flour <em>sifted</em></li>
            <li>1 large egg <em>beaten</em></li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups frying oil</li>
            <li>Sugar for dusting</li>
            <li>1 tsp. ground cinammon for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make Dough.</strong> Heat the water, vanilla extract, salt, and butter in saucepan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the mix is at a <em>rolling boil</em>, stir in flour all at once.</li>
            <li>Mix dough vigorously using a wooden spoon <em>very quickly</em>.</li>
            <li>Take the pan off heat and let cool for about a minute. Add the egg, and mix until the egg is completely incorporated into the dough. The dough should be smooth and soft, and should seperate from the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li><strong>Prep Pastry Bag.</strong> Place the dough in the pastry bag fitted with a star-shaped tip. There should be <em>no</em> air bubbles in the dough.</li>
            <li>Pipe out 6-inch strips on a tray covered with parchement paper. Also, prepare a plate or tray with paper towels to place the churro on after. <em>Do not touch the churros or oil after they are bubbling in the oil.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Pipe and Cook.</strong> Fry the churros for about 2 minutes in 320F oil or until golden brown. Turn and repeat for even color.</li>
            <li>Once done, remove from heat and place on prepared plate to drain for a few seconds, and then immediately roll in sugar and cinammon mix.</li>
            <li>Serve with melted chocolate.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
